**To-Do List** - Here I develop and design a TO-DO LIST using html, css, and javascript. (IDE- Visual Studio Code)

**Stopwatch and Timer** - Here I develop and design a STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN TIMER interface using html, css, and javascript. These two interfaces have the buttons like START, PAUSE, RESTART. The Countdown timer is set for 5 minutes and when the 5 minutes time is over it is shown that "Time's Up". And the Stopwatch has the ability to count the time as long as the user wants. (IDE - Visual Studio Code)
